    content: `<b>What is the 528 Turtles Club?</b><br /><br />
    The 528 Turtles Club is a limited NFT collection that doubles as your membership to a futuristic utopian DAO Republik known as Crypto528. A DAO Republik is a decentralized blockchain society where each token holder becomes a Citizen and has their rights protected by an official Constitution. In the Crypto528 Republik, Citizens can vote to elect Chancellors to represent them on the DAO governance board which is known as the 528 Order. By encoding the rights of Citizens into smart contracts, the power of the society always remains in the hands of its people.`,

    content: `Over the last decade, blockchain technology has seen more and more widespread adoption and as its use cases continue to build, it is beginning to reshape various industries across the globe. As blockchain technology continues to evolve, new concepts such as Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) have the ability to reshape not just private industry, but also our elected democracies.`,

Todas as decis√µes e transa√ß√µes s√£o transparentes, e as regras sobre como gastar o dinheiro da organiza√ß√£o ficam codificadas diretamente em contratos inteligentes que n√£o podem ser alterados.`,

    title: 'What is cryptocurrency?',
    content: `A cryptocurrency is just like a digital form of cash. You can use it
      to pay friends for your share of the bar tab, buy that new pair of
      socks you've been eyeing up üëÄ, or book flights ‚úàÔ∏è and hotels üè® for
      your next holiday. Because cryptocurrency is digital, it can also be
      sent to friends and family anywhere in the world.
      <br />
      <br />
      Just like PayPal or bank transfers, right?
      <br />
      Well, not really. It's way more interesting!
      <br />
      You see, traditional online payment gateways are owned by
      organizations. They hold your money for you, and you need to ask
      them to transfer it on your behalf when you want to spend it.
      <br />
      <br />
      In cryptocurrencies, there isn't an organization. You, your friends,
      and thousands of others can act as your own banks by running free
      software. Your computer connects with other people's computers,
      meaning you communicate directly ‚Äì no middlemen required!
      <br />
      <br />
      To use cryptocurrency, you don't need to sign up for a website with
      an email address and password. You can download a wide variety of
      apps onto your smartphone to begin sending and receiving within
      minutes.`,

    title: 'What is Blockchain?',
    content: `Don't be spooked by the technobabble that people use to describe "blockchain." A blockchain is just a database. It isn't a particularly sophisticated one, either - you could create it in a spreadsheet with minimal effort.      <br />
      <br />There are some peculiarities with these databases. The first is that blockchains are append-only. That means that you can only add information - you can't just click on a cell and delete stuff that you've already added, or change it in any way.The second is that each entry (called a block) in the database is cryptographically linked to the last entry. In plain English, each new entry must contain a sort of digital fingerprint (hash) of the last one. And that's it! Since each fingerprint points back to the last one, you end up with a chain of blocks. Or - as the cool kids like to call it - a blockchain.       <br />
      <br /> A blockchain is immutable: if you change a block, it changes the fingerprint. And since that fingerprint is included in the next block, the next block is changed too. And since that block's fingerprint... well, you get the idea. You end up with a domino effect where any change becomes evident. You can't alter any information without everyone noticing.`,

    content: `It might seem like right now, there is a DAO for everything. A DAO to buy the Constitution, a DAO to buy a sports team, a DAO to run for president (kidding). But there is no escaping the fact that DAOs have sprung up in almost every industry as a new, Web3 way to run a project.</br></br>What are the benefits of DAOs, and why do so many people turn to them when they have a big idea?</br></br>Decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs, can provide a better way to coordinate groups of people who want to bring about change. DAOs allow people living in different parts of the world to work together trustlessly without intermediaries. DAOs enable businesses, charities and other organizations to source investment globally as soon as they launch.Perhaps most importantly, DAOs are inherently democratic; their members receive a fair share of any profits and have a say in how their organization operates.This guide explores what DAOs are, how they work and the costs and benefits associated with launching a DAO to jumpstart your big idea, instead of building a traditional organization.</br></br>At the end of this guide, we explain how to build your own DAO on two platforms: Aragon and DAOhaus,`,

    title: 'What Is Yield Farming in Decentralized Finance (DeFi)?',
    content: `Yield farming is a way to make more crypto with your crypto. It involves you lending your funds to others through the magic of computer programs called smart contracts. In return for your service, you earn fees in the form of crypto. Simple enough, huh? Well, not so fast. <br/> <br/>
    Yield farmers will use very complicated strategies. They move their cryptos around all the time between different lending marketplaces to maximize their returns. They‚Äôll also be very secretive about the best yield farming strategies. Why? The more people know about a strategy, the less effective it may become. Yield farming is the wild west of Decentralized Finance (DeFi), where farmers compete to get a chance to farm the best crops.`,

    content: `The goal of Crypto528 is to create a blockchain democracy built on transparency and openness, where each member of the community has a voice which is heard by those guiding the Republik. Through the use of blockchain technology, the laws of democracy can be written into smart contracts making them immutable and transparent. It also gives each individual Citizen the ability to have a say on how the Republik functions, and ensures that the ultimate power always resides in the hands of the people. `,
